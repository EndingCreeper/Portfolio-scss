## [[[The Problem]]]asdf
This was a real motherfucker of a project. Facebook approached ISL in March 2015 to create a data visualization of Facebook Trends the Facebook Trends API for their F8 developer conference. The project had a hellishly tight timeline, with concepting, design, and development packed into 8 weeks.  This was my first WebGL project and first 3d project.

## Concepting
We knew that it would be a highly visible installation at the conference, seen on several 80" displays. 3d was decided upon at the beginning, in order to create something as visually engaging and interesting as possible.  ISL pitched a concept that invovled cards that floated in 3d space, with API calls on one side and the returned data on the other.  Facebook liked the idea, but we knew we could do better.

After we realized that the F8 is as much for media folks and marketers as it is for developers, I floated the idea of representing trends as a whirling galaxy of shapes rather than cards. Tapping each "solar system" would take you into that individual trend, with the Facebook posts that make up the trend represented as planets.  It might be less strictly informative, but far more fun to interact with (and also way more challenging to build, we'll get to that).

## Design
Due to the crazy time crunch, and both the designer's and my own lack of experience with 3d, we we much more collaborative in design. We iterated like crazy.  The galaxy of shapes was quickly ruled out, simply because it would take far too much time to actually build the thing.  We moved on to a concept representing each trend as an atom within a molecule, and each post as an orbiting electron.

We progressed fairly far with the molecule concept, but ended up ditching the orbiting posts. I felt that they created a lot of visual noise and confusion, and was concerned that people would want to interact with them and grow frustrated as they were moving too fast to hit with a tap.

We settled on an abstract cloud of floating 3d shapes.  Tapping a shape
